The spirit came to be, and from\nit, time and space were born...\rThat seems to point to legendary\nDIALGA, the Pokémon of time, and\fPALKIA, the Pokémon of space...\rAnd they lead back to ARCEUS, the\nPokémon that made them arise.\rIsn’t this interesting?\nWould you like to hear some more?</language>
