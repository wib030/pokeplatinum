// I like how Pokémon can use attacks.\nThat makes things fun and different.\rSometimes, when they get stronger,\nPokémon learn new moves.\rThat keeps things fresh and fun when\nusing moves.

// Did you buy some Heal Balls at the\nPoké Mart?\rA Heal Ball completely heals the\nPokémon it captures on the spot.\rThat means you can catch a Pokémon\nand have it battle-ready right away.\rOf course, if your team has six\nPokémon in it, it won’t do any good.
